This was supposed to be a sports blog.  

This website is run by two sports ~~obssessianados~~ ~~lovers~~ enthusiasts, but its first posts won't be related to sports at all.  If you're wondering why, which I hope you are, it's because we simply can't afford to think too much about sports right now.  I'm working on applying last month's principle of Put First Things First, and working on fixing my wrecked school life.  

Starting with an all out blitz of an experiment.  (Pun was fitting, but unintended)
### Learning From an Experiment in Studying

Or Studying an Experiment in Learning?  Regardless, the goal will be to use everything I've learned about efficiently doing well in college to...do well in college.  For us, doing well in college means making meaningful connections, doing interesting things, and learning an abundance of material on our way to the ultimate goal of a 4.0.

I've created three phases? stages? parts?  of a 5? step program to onboard us and to get me back on track.  In an effort to gain more data, with the added benefit of helping them earn a 4.0 (we believe), an anonymous person will be completing the program with me.  Their chosen alias is 'Tom Boy'.  

The three parts of this system are Planning Engagements, Learning Material, and Completing Assignments.  I believe these to be the main components of achieving a 4.0, so the system will start out by focusing here, before changing as needed.

### The Goal

I'll elaborate on the Goal and on the broader system in a later post, but putting First Things First, I need to build a system for myself to finish out the semester before I do anything else.

Signing out / Best Wishes,
