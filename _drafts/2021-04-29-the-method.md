## The Method

In my last post, I introduced the experiment series I am currently working on.  In this post I will describe the system we will be following in detail.

##  Planning Engagements

Planning engagements is likely the most critical part of this system, so naturally it will have to be implemented first.
Our lab rats will start off with one simple task: every morning or every night, they must plan their days.  
I will add a link and some images with the style and motivation later.
This simple, but critical piece of the puzzle will soon give way to making a list of engagements in advance and starting a rough plan for their weeks.

Participants will break down all tasks into subtasks that they can do within a week (a day?) and add them to their weekly plans.   


Participants will put long term deadlines in 2 modes, an electronic document system and a paper and pen planner (for maximum visibility).  Whiteboards are also useful for this.

In my head: planning habit 4 weeks straight
				-week 1: daily planning
                -week 2: weekly planning and daily planning
                -week 3: long-term planning and weeks 1 & 2
			learning habits for last 2 weeks
            	-week 1: Previewing and QEC notes with 10 minute walks
                -week 2: Reviewing and Concept Maps
            completing assignments across final week
            	-scoreboard: weeks without an L?  Certain number of weeks adds up to a reward?
                -cadence of positive accountability
